<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello!</p>

<p>My name is Patrick and I'm new to coding. I've been taking a course on Udemy because I want to explore options for
  a change in career. So far, I like it. There's a lot to learn though. In my professional career, I've been a training manager,
  I've worked in sales, and I've been a marketing manager and public relations manager.I enjoy writing, and I enjoy coding. 
  I'm hoping I can put the two together and find new opportunities for my career.</p>
